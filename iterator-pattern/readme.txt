Iterator:
    - Behavioural
    - Allows us to loop over some collection of objects.
    - It is a common programming task to traverse and manipulate a collection of objects.
    - These collections can be either arrays or complex ones like trees, graphs

    - In order to traverse these collections, you may need to access the items in the collection in certain order.
        - like front to back or vice versa, DFS, BFS,...


Scenario 1:
-----------
- Define an iterator to iterate through array of different data types.
