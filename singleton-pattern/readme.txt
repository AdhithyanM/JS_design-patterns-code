Singleton:
    - creational pattern
    - comes in handy when we want to limit the no.of objects creation to one.
    - guarantees there is only one instance of that object.


Scenario 1:
-----------
- I want to write a program that manages the processes
- 2 main component of this program is  
    - the processes   (many)
    - the process manager    (only one)
- Singleton can be used.
