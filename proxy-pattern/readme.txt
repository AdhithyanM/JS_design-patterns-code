Proxy:
    - It allows us to use one object known as a proxy as a placeholder to another object.
    - Proxy can control access to that object.
    - So, instead of using that object directly, we use the proxy and the proxy uses that object.

    In what cases?
        - To add extra functionalities

Scenario 1:
-----------
- Let us say we build a program that displays values for different cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL
- but to get those values we need to hit some external APIs.. 
- simulate this.
