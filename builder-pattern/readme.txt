Builder:
    - Creational
    - Used to construct complex objects piece by piece
    - by creating a new instance of some object with some baseline properties
    - and then from there we can add properties to that object one by one as needed.
    - and finally we construct our fully constructed object.

    Goal:
        - to separate an object construction from its representation.


Scenario 1:
-----------
- There is a person object with properties name, weight, height, gender
- write a code which shouldn't let us confuse with what args we pass for what params.
