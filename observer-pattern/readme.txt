Observer:
    - Behavioural
    - We define one to many dependency relationship 
    - from one object known as the subject to many other objects known as the observers.
    - these observers can be functions that watch the subject and wait for some trigger from the subject before they run.
    - eg: event listeners
    - commonly used in event handling systems.
